High priority:
	make work consistently with any theme
	refactor get_contact_form_shortcode() once https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/102 is fixed
		if doesn't happen soon, then add admin notice if missing page w/ contact form or it's not published
	
Medium priority:
	add color pickers
	update image preview after they pick new but before they save/refresh
	contact form shortcode - lookup email from wordcamp cpt instead of admin email?
	internationalize
	any other TODOs in code
	customize image size in template
	make the date lookup less fragile? maybe store blog id in wordcamp post type meta so don't have to rely on url, or just parse_url() to make matching easier
	
	
Low priority:
	styles
		make responsive & mobile-first
		make contact box align w/ right edge of intro text properly instead of workaround
	make dashes/underscores consistent in html element ids/names
